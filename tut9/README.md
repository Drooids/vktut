Beyond Tutorial 8
=================

By Tutorial 8, we went through most of what Vulkan has to offer in their most
primal form.  At this point, one should be able to apply their computer
graphics knowledge and use Vulkan, figuring out any details along the way.

That said, the tutorials from here on focus on some of these details, and are
results of my own experiments with Vulkan.

If you feel you have learned enough of Vulkan, Tutorial 8 is the best point to
stop.
